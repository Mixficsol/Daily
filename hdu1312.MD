> Problem Description
> There is a rectangular room, covered with square tiles. Each tile is colored either red or black. A man is standing on a black > > tile. From a tile, he can move to one of four adjacent tiles. But he can't move on red tiles, he can move only on black tiles.
> 
> Write a program to count the number of black tiles which he can reach by repeating the moves described above. 
>  
>
> Input
> The input consists of multiple data sets. A data set starts with a line containing two positive integers W and H; W and H are the > numbers of tiles in the x- and y- directions, respectively. W and H are not more than 20.
> 
> There are H more lines in the data set, each of which includes W characters. Each character represents the color of a tile as > > > follows.
> 
> '.' - a black tile 
> '#' - a red tile 
> '@' - a man on a black tile(appears exactly once in a data set) 
>  
> 
> Output
> For each data set, your program should output a line which contains the number of tiles he can reach from the initial tile 
> (including itself).
